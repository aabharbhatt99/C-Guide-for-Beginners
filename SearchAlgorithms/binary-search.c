//BINARY SEARCH
// make a searching algorithm of binary search
//hint
//for binary searching the array must be sorted (let's suppose in ascending way)
//binary search works as to find the required element, the middle element of the array is selected and checked
//if the required element is greater than the middle element then the right side of the array is searched again until the req. no. is found
